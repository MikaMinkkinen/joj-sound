# JÒJ Sound
This repository contains JÒJ Sound logo originals.

Please use vector formats if possible. With Adobe Illustrator (CC) or editable PDF formats you can scale the originals any size you want. 

If you scale original logos, remember keep the porpotions right and scale also thickness of stroke in same scale.

Every time when you use this logo, remember ask publishing permission from Jiri Ruotsalainen (DJ Selecta).

If you have any problems or advises with these files, please contact me, and I`ll fix the material.

Enjoy the work!

# Notes for Designer
There are few versions of the logo and you are free to choose which version suits the best for your design. There are no specific color or font specs. You can use your creativity.

# Notes for Producer
There are few different filetypes of each version of logo. Orderer should specify which version of logo he/she wants to use, but you can choose which format is the best for your production environment. 

# Notes for Orderer
Make clear order and specify which version of the logo you want to use. Logo versions with more details fits better for high quality prints. Logo versions with less details suits better in smaller sizes or rougher materials or low-fi printing techniques.
